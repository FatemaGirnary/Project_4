# Project_4
For Project 4, you will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned. Here are the specific requirements:
1.	Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2.	Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
3.	You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
4.	Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5.	You must use at least two of the following:
o	Python Pandas
o	Python Matplotlib
o	HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
o	JavaScript Plotly
o	JavaScript Leaflet
o	SQL Database
o	MongoDB Database
o	Google Cloud SQL
o	Amazon AWS
o	Tableau

Since this is a two-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project by the end of the first week to stay on track.
Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.

Support and Resources
Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You will also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics as needed. Make sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this first project.

Project Guidelines
The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, your project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.

Collaborating with Your Team
Remember that these projects are a group effort. The experience of close collaboration will create better project outcomes and help you in your future careers. Specifically, you’ll learn collaborative workflows that will enable you to approach and solve complex problems. Working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage!

Project Proposal
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This will help provide direction and safeguard against scope creep (the tendency for projects to become more complex after work begins).
The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:
•	The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)
•	The questions you’ll ask of the data
•	Possible source for the data


Data Cleanup and Analysis
Now that you’ve picked your data, it’s time to tackle development and analysis. This is where the fun starts!
The analysis process can be broken into two broad phases: (1) exploration and cleanup, and (2) analysis.
As you’ve learned, you’ll need to explore, clean, and reformat your data before you can begin answering your research questions. We recommend keeping track of these exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter notebook to keep you organized and make it easier to present your work later.
After you’ve cleaned your data and are ready to start crunching numbers, you should track your work in a Jupyter notebook dedicated specifically to analysis. We recommend focusing your analysis on multiple techniques, such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time-series analysis. Don’t forget to include plots during both the exploration and analysis phases. Creating plots along the way can reveal insights and interesting trends in the data that you might not notice if you wait until you’re preparing for your presentation. Presentation requirements will be further explained in the next module.
Presentation Day
It’s crucial that you find time to rehearse before presentation day.
On the day of your presentation, each member of your group is required to submit the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.
